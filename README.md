# Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project

- Uses the Kaggle Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival.
- Implements Logistic Regression for binary classification.
- Performs data preprocessing including missing value handling and encoding.
- Trains the model using features like class, gender, age, and fare.
- Generates a Kaggle-compatible `submission.csv` with 418 entries.
- Includes an interactive Streamlit web interface for live predictions.
- Demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow.
